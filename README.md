## Introduction

Flappy Bird AI merges the well-known Flappy Bird game with an AI bot that utilizes genetic algorithms to learn and play the game effectively.

## Files

The repository includes the following files:

- **Flappybird-AI.html**: HTML file for the game interface.
- **Matrix.js**: Contains matrix math operations for data manipulation.
- **actFUNC.js**: Contains activation functions used in the neural network.
- **ai.js**: Implements the genetic algorithm-based AI logic for playing Flappy Bird.
- **alice.js**: contains brain for the agents
- **civ.js**: establishes a society of agents
- **flappy.js**: Implements the core logic for the Flappy Bird game.
- **min.js**: d3js min version
- **obs.js**: Manages obstacles in the game.
- **test.js**: some genetic algo functions
- **utils.js**: Contains utility functions.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up Flappy Bird AI on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open `Flappybird-AI.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Observe the AI bot playing Flappy Bird by running the game usinng Flappybird.htm. The AI is designed to learn and adapt its gameplay over time.

## Genetic Algorithms

The genetic algorithm logic is implemented in the `ai.js` file. It utilizes genetic algorithms to evolve neural networks for effective gameplay. Feel free to explore and customize the genetic algorithms as needed.
